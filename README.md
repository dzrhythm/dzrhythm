Hi, I’m David Zientara (@dzrhythm). I'm currently employed as a Cloud Solution Architect
at [Applied Information Sciences (AIS)](https://www.ais.com/).

I’m interested in cloud-native application architecture and development, domain-driven design,
containers and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), DevOps, AI/ML, and Cloud technologies.
